things to do:

1) Finalize all valid movement generation
    - Castling
    - Kings
        - Kings need extra love
        - Need to know that they are not under threat in a given situation
        - Is king in check?
        - Is the location that the king is moving to safe?
        - Check behavior

2) Connect all moves to move maker
3) Update all comments and doxygen/headers/bs
5) Decouple moves from function protoypes for generating moves
    - Moves are now a member of the class
6) Decouple move evaluation from move generation
    - Well in reality this may not work out as originally intended, because
      in order to sort based on move values, we need to evaluate the follow-on
      board and 
7) Ensure that moves are in a sorted order
8) Basic function for calculating chessboard value for a given position
9) Clean up basic Util_Assert procedure vs error return codes
