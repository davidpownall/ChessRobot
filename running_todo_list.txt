things to do:

1) Finalize all valid movement generation
    - Castling
    - Kings
        - Kings need extra love
        - Is king in check?
        - Is the location that the king is moving to safe?
        - Check behavior

2) Update all comments and doxygen/headers/bs
3) Clean up basic Util_Assert procedure vs error return codes
4) Unit level testing of move generation for a given piece type
5) Integration level testing of the board as whole
